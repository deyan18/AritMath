# ArithMath - Kotlin Math Game App

This project was developed as part of the "Master's Degree in Software Engineering: Cloud, Data, and Information Technology Management" program. ArithMath is a simple multiplication game app developed in Kotlin for Android. The app allows users to guess the correct answer for given multiplication problems and provides features such as user high score, lives, countdown timer, points, and level up functionality.

## Features

- User Highscore: The app keeps track of the user's high score, allowing them to compete with themselves and improve their performance.
- Three Lives: Users start with three lives and lose a life with every incorrect answer. When all lives are lost, the game ends.
- Countdown Timer: The app includes a countdown timer, and if the timer runs out, the user loses the game.
- Points: Users can accumulate points by answering correctly, and when they reach 100 points, they level up.
- Level Up: When users level up, their lives are replenished, their countdown time is increased, and the operations are harder providing an additional challenge.

## What I Learned

During the development of ArithMath, I gained several new skills and knowledge, including:

- Kotlin programming: This project was my first experience with Kotlin, and I learned how to use Kotlin in Android app development.
- Shared Preferences: I learned how to use Shared Preferences in Android to store and retrieve user data, such as high scores and level information.
- Android Interface Design: I gained experience in designing user interfaces for Android apps, including creating layouts, handling user inputs, and displaying feedback to the user.

## Getting Started

To run ArithMath on your Android device or emulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the app on your Android device or emulator.

## Future Development

ArithMath is a basic version of a math game app, and there are several potential areas for future development, including:

- Adding more game modes, such as division, addition, and subtraction.
- Implementing a leaderboard to allow users to compete with other players.
- Adding sound effects and animations to enhance the user experience.
- Incorporating in-app purchases for additional features or content.
- Implementing a backend server to store user data and enable multiplayer functionality.

## Conclusion

ArithMath has been a valuable learning experience for me, as it was my first Kotlin app and provided me with insights into Android app development and interface design. I plan to continue improving and expanding the app based on user feedback and my own ideas.
